### Description of Project

The purpose of this project is to create a responsive photo-sharing web-app from a Figma project brief using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website was constructed using pure HTML code from scratch, 
while the styles and design were set using CSS. The website uses media queriess to function properly across any screen-size, including, but not limited to mobile devices, tablets, a standard 
desktops and laptop computers. The website is designed to allow for users to share pictures of their favorite destinations around the United States, while allowing other users to like and comment on 
these pictures. 

The website's interactivity was created using JavaScript, especifically targetting the Document Object Model (DOM) to provide for a strong user experience. The web-app includes three modal windows 
that all perform different actions such as, allowing users to change their display name and title, allowing users to add new images, and allowing users to view the pictures on a larger modal. The 
modal forms were validated to allow for users to only enter valid information before being able to use it.

**Images**  
  
The images used in this project can be found on the 
[Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ii4xxsJ0ghevUOcssTlHZv/Sprint-3%3A-Around-the-US?node-id=0%3A1) that was used as a design mechanism to 
build this website


### Plans for Improvement

Use React and back-end capabilities to continue improving user experience and allow for chnages made by users to be saved and viewed later on.
