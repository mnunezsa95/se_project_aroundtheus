### Intro

The AroundTheUS application resembles Instagram, allowing users to view images posted on their "wall." Users can interact with the images by liking them or clicking to zoom in. Additionally, users have the flexibility to modify their profile picture, change their name, and add new images to post on the wall. The application adheres to responsive web-design principles, ensuring a seamless experience across a variety of screen sizes.

To send and retrieve user data, the application makes API calls to an external API hosted by TripleTen.

Note: The frontend version of this application will automatically direct the user to my account.

### Description of Project

The website was crafted with pure HTML code from the ground up, and the styles and design were implemented using CSS. Employing media queries ensures proper functionality across various screen sizes, including mobile devices, tablets, and standard desktops and laptops. The platform is designed for users to share images of their favorite destinations in the United States, enabling others to like and comment on these pictures.

JavaScript and ES6 classes were employed, specifically focusing on the Document Object Model (DOM), to elevate the website's interactivity and deliver a robust user experience. The web app incorporates three modal windows, each catering to distinct functionalities such as enabling users to modify their display name and title, upload new images, and view pictures in a larger modal. Validation of modal forms was implemented to guarantee that users input valid information before utilizing them.

Webpack and Babel were utilized to optimize the application for production and ensure support for modern JavaScript syntax across various browsers.
