### Description of Project

The purpose of this project is to create a responsive website that functions properly on mobile devices, tablets and a standard desktop 
or laptop computer. The webiste was developed using a grid and flexbox. The website is design to allow for users to share pictures of 
their favorite destinations around the United States, while allowing other users to like and comment on these pictures. 

To create this website, the initial design was created by Practicum USA on Figma. From there, the design was brought to reality using 
HTML and CSS. 
  
**Figma**  

* Figma was used as a prototype for the website

**Images**  
  
The images used in this project can be found on the 
[Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ii4xxsJ0ghevUOcssTlHZv/Sprint-3%3A-Around-the-US?node-id=0%3A1) that was used as a design mechanism to 
build this website


### Plans for Improvement

Once a foundational understanding of JavaScript is formulated, the idea is to make the project more interactive by users. The idea is 
that this will allow other users to add likes and comments on images.
